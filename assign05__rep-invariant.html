<b>Goal:</b>
JUnit, Abstraction Function, and Rep-Invariants</p>
<ol>
<li> First you need to learn how to write JUnit tests (go over the JUnit tutorials). You are provided with the following files to help you write tests and run them: run.bat, hamcrest-core-1.3.jar, junit-4.13.1.jar, AllTests.java, BoundedQueueTester.java, BoundedQueueBuggy1Tester.java, BoundedQueueBuggy2Tester.java.
</li><li> Implement the provided rep-invariant in "boolean repOK()". Also implement the Abstraction Function for class BoundedQueue. Recall that in Java the AF is implemented as the "String toString()" method. The squeletons for repOk() and toString() are provided.  
</li><li>After implementing repOk() and toString(), add the following tests to BoundedQueueTester: a) one happy-path test for each of isEmpty(), isFull(), put(), get(), putAll(), getAll(); b) one test that throws an exception for each of put(), get(), putAll(), getAll(); c) at least five tests for your implementation of toString(). 
Note that the six tests in a) should additionally include the following assertion at their respective ends "assertTrue(someBoundedQueue.repOk()), to ensure that the repOK() was not violated.
</li><li>Create a duplicate of class BoundedQueue, called BoundedQueueBuggy1. Inject a bug in BoundedQueueBuggy1, e.g., delete a statement or change/add an operator etc. Your injected bug should violate the rep-invariant.
Add comments in BoundedQueueBuggy1 identifying your injected bug.
</li><li>Write one or more tests in BoundedQueueBuggy1Tester that will exercise your injected bug and violate repOk().
</li><li>Repeat the last 2 steps by creating BoundedQueueBuggy2 and BoundedQueueBuggy2Tester.
</li></ol>
